Analysis: VM vs App Service

To deploy my CMS web app, I compared using an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) and an Azure App Service by looking at cost, scalability, availability, and how easy each one is to work with.

In terms of cost, Azure App Service is cheaper for small to medium apps because you only pay for what you use. A VM costs more since it runs all the time and you pay for the full compute power, even when no one is using the app.

For scalability, App Service is much simpler. You can scale your app up or down with just a few clicks, or even set it to scale automatically when traffic increases. With a VM, you have to set up scaling manually, which takes more time and effort.

When it comes to availability, App Service automatically provides high availability with built-in backups and load balancing. With a VM, I would need to manually set up availability zones or extra instances to ensure the app stays online.

Lastly, for workflow, App Service makes deployment super easy. I can connect it directly to GitHub or deploy straight from my code editor. It also works smoothly with other Azure services like SQL Database and Blob Storage. With a VM, I’d have to install everything, configure servers, and handle deployments myself.

Choice: Azure App Service

I decided to use Azure App Service for deploying the CMS app.

Justification

Azure App Service is the best fit because it’s easy to set up, affordable, and requires very little maintenance. It automatically handles all the backend work like managing the server, applying updates, and keeping everything secure. This lets me focus on improving the app instead of managing infrastructure. It also integrates easily with Azure SQL Database for storing articles and Azure Blob Storage for saving images. Since it supports automatic scaling and has built-in monitoring, it’s reliable and simple to manage. Overall, App Service gives me everything I need for this CMS without the complexity and cost of using a VM.

When My Decision Might Change

I would consider using a Virtual Machine if my CMS app needed more control over the environment or had special requirements. For example, if I needed to install custom software, run background processes, or handle very heavy workloads, a VM would make more sense. A VM is also better if I needed full control over the operating system or wanted to host multiple applications on the same machine.

For this project, though, Azure App Service is the smarter and easier choice — it’s reliable, cost-effective, and perfect for a small web app like this CMS.
